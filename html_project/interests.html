                Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and
                composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of
                expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which
                update the running state of the program.

                    In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class
                    citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names, passed as arguments, and returned from other
                    functions, just as any other data type can.

            <h4>Graph theory</h4>

                Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations
                between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices which are
                connected by edges. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in discrete mathematics.
                <span class="desktop-info">
                    Graphs can
                    be used to model many types of relations and processes in physical, biological, social and
                    information systems. Many practical problems can be represented by graphs.
