            <h4>Functional programming</h4>

                Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which programs are created by applying and
                composing functions. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class
                objects, meaning that they can be bound to names, passed as arguments, and returned from other
                functions.
                <span class="desktop-info">
                    Functional programming evolved from lambda calculus, a formal system of computation based only on
                    functions.
                    Some functional programming languages are: Haskell, Erlang and Elixir.
                    Many other languages also implement functional programming paradigm, e.g. JavaScript, C++, Java.

                Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations
                between objects. A graph is a structure composed of vertices and edges that connect vertices. Graphs are
                one of the principal objects of study in discrete mathematics.

                    They can
                    be used to model many types of relations and processes in physical, biological, social and
                    information systems. Many practical problems can be represented by graphs.
