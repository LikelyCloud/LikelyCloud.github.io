            <p>
                American football is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with
                goalposts at each end. The offense attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or
                passing it, while the defense aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for
                themselves.
                <span class="desktop-info">
                    American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. The
                    first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams.
